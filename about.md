## About this Site
Hi all, my name is Mark and welcome to my little corner on the internet! 

I started this site for a number of reasons. Firstly to improve my own writing and to reinforce my own learning. You tend to learn a much more by articulating topics and I for one can see technologies from a more subjective standpoint by writing about them. It's good to read on different perspectives out there and this is my own contribution. Secondly, writing serves as additional material for myself on different subjects and acts as a series of helpful reminders. Then last but not least, I wanted to create a hub for any future personal projects that I had in mind. Hopefully some of this material is also useful to yourselves. 

## About Me
I have been a Software Engineer within the industry for over 7 years now and London is currently my home. Since I moved to London as a student in 2010, I've settled here, met my fiancee` and I have been both living and working here ever since. 

My experience has largely been within Finance, FinTech's and Investment Banks as a fullstack developer. Along the way (in no particular order) I have gained experience and industry exposure to Java, modern JavaScript, C#/.NET, Python alongside many other technologies and frameworks out there. More recently, Java has been at the forefront of my development work but I try to stay agnostic of any technology in general. Over the years I have taken an interest in learning about and building scaleable, performanent backend services and applications, be it greenfield or legacy systems. 

My hobbies outside software development include, travelling, reading/audiobooks, a dash of cooking, running, home improvements and cinema.
